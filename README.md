# Stock Prediction Model  

Here is a project that I'm utilizing the free stock data from
[Kaggle - S&P500](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500).

This project will be able to ingest stocks from multiple companies, transform it to the
data format that we'd like, and then run it through the ML model that I have built
(utilizing Linear Regression).  

## How to Use
